# Donut Hell

You've reached [DONUT HEAVEN](https://kaikue.itch.io/donut-heaven)... can you conquer Donut Hell?

Extra-challenging "B-Side" levels for [Donut Heaven](https://kaikue.itch.io/donut-heaven). Playing that game first is highly recommended.

"Donut Heaven" concept by baku ([@bakumoe](https://twitter.com/bakumoe)): https://famicase.com/21/softs/010.html

## TODO

- interrupt jumps/dashes/dives with other moves
- level 1 (fix music loop?)
	- dash then turn back in midair
	- small jump so you don't hit your head (after dash)
- level 2
	- repeated dash up jelly wall with spikes close on other side
	- dribble on bouncer while waiting for something
	- several chained long donut bounces
- level 3
	- double-jump, dash, fall, bounce, quickly dash to avoid hitting spikes on ceiling
	- dash under tight spike "crusher" hallway
	- use sugar walls to refill dash/jump & climb (they must respawn on death)
	- many refill crystals in path through full spikes
	- end: long fall
- level 4
	- jumps on small gaps in spike-covered platform
	- dribble on donut bouncer sliding back and forth
	- vocals trigger for later section
	- ending: can get killed in walk up- spikes with small gap moving up & down that you have to time, sugar wall blocking gap that you have to break underneath
