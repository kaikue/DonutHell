For AGBIC 2021: https://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2021

Concept by baku ([@bakumoe](https://twitter.com/bakumoe)): https://famicase.com/21/softs/010.html

## TODO

- mechanics (test):
	- sugar walls respawn on death
	- cycles reset on death
- interrupt jumps/dashes/dives with other moves
- level 1
- level 2
	- repeated dash up jelly wall with spikes close on other side
	- dribble on bouncer while waiting for something
	- several chained long donut bounces
- level 3
	- double-jump, dash, fall, bounce, quickly dash to avoid hitting spikes on ceiling
	- dash under tight spike "crusher" hallway
	- use sugar walls to refill dash/jump & climb (they must respawn on death)
	- many refill crystals in path through full spikes
	- end: long fall
- level 4
	- jumps on small gaps in spike-covered platform
	- dribble on donut bouncer sliding back and forth
	- ending: can get killed in walk up- spikes with small gap moving up & down that you have to time, sugar wall blocking gap that you have to break underneath
